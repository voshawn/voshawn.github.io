There are times when you need a reminder of how you want to live your life. If you knew exactly who you want to be, maybe you would not catch yourself falling back into bad habits as often.  Even though you will not always live up to your expectations, it is helpful to have a direction for where you want to be and understand the traits you value.

> I live passionately and experience the world for all that it is worth. I challenge myself and dedicate all my efforts to everything I do.  I accept my faults, but am not complacent towards any I can amend. I always remain optimistic and radiate positive energy. I take care of myself, but realize that others depend on me as well. I uphold my reputation and never lie, cheat, or steal. I inspire others, support their ambitions, and help them achieve their goals. I nurture my old relationships and develop new ones. I treat everyone I encounter with empathy and respect. I love, in every sense of the word.  I remember where I came from and am grateful for where I am. I am true to my principles, my priorities, and ultimately, myself.
