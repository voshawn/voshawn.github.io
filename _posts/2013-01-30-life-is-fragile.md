We work hard to achieve success, acquire wealth, and to be the person we have always wanted to be. We are fixated on our goals and take pride in every faint glimmer of accomplishment. Seldom do we give thought to the gloomier side of life.

Despite of what we want to believe, there is a side of life where you canâ€™t find a job, develop a debilitating disease, lose a loved one, or face death yourself. Regardless of how hard you work, how often you go to the gym, or how cautious you live, it only takes a little bad luck to turn your whole life around.

Not only is this true for you, but it is also true for your family, your best friends, the woman walking past you, that homeless man on the streets, and those starving kids across the world you will never even see.

As humans, we are much more fragile than we would like to believe. Physically we are extremely weak. We can try to make it up through our intelligence, but often, even that falls short.

If we have one thing going for us, it is the ability to empathize. We treat each other well because we share the same struggles. We help everyone in need because we know how it feels to be helpless. We try to give as much as we can because that is the closest we can come to immortality.

In the end, all of our personal success, wealth, and goals that we worked so hard for will die with us.

What we took away from this world will no longer matter. Our only lasting impact will be what we gave back to it.
