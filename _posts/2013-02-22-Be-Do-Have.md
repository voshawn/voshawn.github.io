We are conditioned to believe that we need to have and do things before we can feel a certain way. For example, if we are hungry, we need to have food and eat it before we are satiated. While framework is true for many things, it can be dangerous to live life through this mindset. Do we need have a gym membership and lose ten pounds in order to feel confident? Do we need to have money and go on nice vacations in order to be happy?

Ultimately everyoneâ€™s end goal is to be secure, successful, comfortable, happy, ect... When we view our lives through this *have, do, be* lens, it is easy to confuse our ultimate goal of *being* with our intermediate goal of *having*. We measure our milestones through our material possessions because we believe that they directly map to our state of being, but nothing can be further from the truth.

Instead, we should first focus on being. Whether we want to be free, content, or happy, we should make these states of being independent of what we have. Once we achieve these states, they will guide us to do things that reinforce them. If we are already happy, we will keep on doing things that make we happier. Consequently, through these actions, we will end up having what really matters.
